nose. The M4 that BMW \n                        loaned us was painted a nauseating chartreuse, marketed as \n                        Sao Paulo yellow presumably because it kinda-sorta looks like a\n                         Brazilian World Cup jersey. It also had far too much carbon fiber\n                          frippery, was full of the electronic nonsense that seems to \n                          compel people to sign low-mileage two-year leases, and carried a\n                           sticker within a snot rocket of $100,000. But none of those \n                           things mattered, because at the M4’s essential core is a \n                           473-horsepower twin-turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine,\n                            a poised and aggressive rear-drive chassis, and the superstar \n                            275/35ZR19 front and 285/30ZR20 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4S\n                             tires it wears.
