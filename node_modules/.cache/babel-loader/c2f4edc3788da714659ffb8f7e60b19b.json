The finishing touch \n           is the trims, all of which have been changed for fresh ones and they’ve been\n            painted with Joni’s own blend of black and textured matt finish.\n                     <br></br><br></br>\n                     Joni Pursiainen<br></br>\n                     December 6, 2019\n                     <div className='buildimgcontainer'>\n                    <img src='e36M31.1.jpg' alt='pic1'/>\n                    <img src='e36M31.2.jpg' alt='pic2'/>\n                    <img src='e36M31.3.jpg' alt='pic3'/>\n                     </div>\n                 </p>\n                </div>\n           \n           \n       </div>\n        \n    )\n}\n\nexport default MainContent\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
